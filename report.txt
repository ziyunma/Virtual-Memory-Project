1. Purpose of experiments and experimental setup.
    
    Using student machine__
    Command line arguments & outputs:

    explanation

2. Describe the custom page replacement algorithm invented

    also draw a diagram for this! show info stored and how it is accessed

3. Measure & graph number of page faults, disk reads and disk writes for
each program with a varying number of frames (3-100) and 100 pages.

    nice labels, good layout, and easy to read...prob just use desmos

4. Explain the nature of results. Is anything unexpected? If any algorithm
performed better than another in certain conditions, point it out, explain
the condition, and explain why it performed better. What general observations
can be made about the page replacement algorithms?
